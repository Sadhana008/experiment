HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. 
It defines the basic framework of a webpage by using tags to represent elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and forms.
HTML does not provide styling or dynamic behavior by itself; instead, it works together with CSS for design and JavaScript for interactivity. 
The main purpose of HTML is to organize content so browsers can display it in a structured and readable way. It acts as the backbone of all websites, ensuring that text, images, and multimedia are properly arranged.
With HTML, developers can create hyperlinks that connect different pages, forming the webâ€™s navigation system. HTML also supports embedding videos, audio, and interactive content to make websites more engaging. 
It is platform-independent, meaning any browser on any device can render HTML pages. Overall, HTML is essential for presenting information on the internet in a user-friendly format.
